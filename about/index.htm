            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>

                <h2>Built by Humans. Backed by Data. Powered by Grit.</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>We didn’t start this business to win medals.
                        We started it because HYROX changed our lives — and we knew it could change yours too.</li>
                    <li>We’re a team of real people from different walks of life, each on our own HYROX journey. Some of us came to it for fat loss. Others to run faster, lift heavier, or just feel a bit more in control again. We're not elite racers (some days we don’t even feel like athletes), but we've experienced first-hand the physical and mental transformation that this kind of hybrid training creates.</li>
                    <li>That’s the fire behind Hybrid Performance Trifecta.</li>
                    <li>We believe performance isn’t about being the best — it’s about being your best. And doing that means balancing more than just workouts. It means looking after your fitness, your mental wellbeing, and your resilience at work and in life. That’s why we built a model that supports all three — and why we coach with empathy, science, and straight-talking honesty.</li>
                    <li>We’re also honest about how we run things.
                        Yes, we use AI to support our programming and customer service — but humans will always be at the core of what we do. You’ll never be left talking to a bot when you’re on a paid plan. You’ll always have access to real coaches for one-to-one support, feedback, and the tough love or encouragement you need to push through.</li>
                    <li>Our backgrounds span certified personal training, endurance sports, coaching, and data science. But more importantly — we’re just like you. We’re balancing jobs, families, goals, and setbacks. We’re showing up day after day to get a little better — and we built Hybrid Performance Trifecta to help others do the same.</li>
                    <li>This is more than a business.
                        It’s a community of hybrid athletes helping each other evolve — and shaping a new standard for what high performance can look like.</li>
                    <li>If that sounds like something you want to be part of, you’re already one of us.</li>
                </ul>
